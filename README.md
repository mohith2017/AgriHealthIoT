## Data Analytics and IoT in Agriculture
This is a repository for the Hackathon conducted by Symphony at the Innovate Asia Event 2019 in Hong Kong's Stock Exchange Venue.

## Details of the project
The main goal of the project was to connect the land owners with the farmer and their owned land by eliminating the need for physical presence at their property.
To achieve this, the idea and flow of the project is uploaded to this repository above.

## Implementation
To achieve our projected goal, we have implemented the following technologies:
1) Arduino sensors based IoT system for humidity, precipitation and temperature detection
2) Private server to remotely analyze data to visualize land requirements
3) Augmented Reality to visualise the owner's land based data(not present in current repo)
